# Manim-Projects
Animations made by me that I feel are worth for the internet.

I recently started to play around with Manim, an animation library created by Grant Sanderson, 3b1b. This repository will contain the code for some of my projects for anyone to look at.

If you created something with my projects as a base, I'd love to look at it as a post in Discussion!
